# Backup of the Full Stack Deep Learning Website

This website came online in January 2021.

It uses `mkdocs`, which you can set up with `make setup`.

To develop locally, run `make serve` and edit the files.

To deploy, push `main` branch to github and it will deploy via github action, or manually run `make deploy`.
